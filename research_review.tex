    \section*{Research review: three developments in AI planning and search}\label{research-review-three-developments-in-ai-planning-and-search}

\subsection*{1) Partial order planning}\label{partial-order-planning}

Partial order planning (POP) does not search the space of states, but
the space of plans. In the most simple form, a plan is a totally ordered
sequence of actions. In the context of the air cargo problems from our
project, a plan to bring two cargo items c1 and c2 from SFO to JFK might
look like this:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    Load(c1, plane, SFO); Load(c2, plane, SFO);
    Fly(plane, SFO, JFK);
    Unload(c1, plane, JFK); Unload(c2, plane, JFK)
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

In this plan, some steps are interchangeable (it does not matter which
cargo item is loaded first), and others are not (flying an empty plane
will not bring the cargo anywhere). POP takes account of this by
replacing the total ordering of the sequence by a partial ordering, e.g.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
    Load(c1, plane, SFO) < Fly(plane, SFO, JFK) and Load(c2, plane, SFO) < Fly(plane, SFO, JFK)
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

POP uses a concept called \emph{causal link} (introduced in Tate (1977))
to remember which action was added to a plan in order to reach which
subgoal. When a new action is added to a plan, we can check whether this
action \emph{threatens} a causal link. If this is the case, the partial
ordering can be extended by specifying that the new action has to be
executed before or after some other actions.\\

POP was the predominant planning approach from the mid-seventies until
the mid-nineties of the last century. Then faster state-space search
algorithms (see below) were developed, and POP went out of fashion. It
was revived by Nguyen and Kambhampati (2001) who transferred the
improvements in heuristics to POP.

\subsection*{2) State-space planning with
heuristics}\label{state-space-planning-with-heuristics}

Forward search in the space of states gained a lot of popularity when
good domain-independent heuristics were developed. The first such system
was HSP (Bonet et al. 1997). The heuristic used by HSP estimates the
distance from a state to the goal by considering a \emph{relaxed
problem:} the delete lists of actions are ignored. The heuristic assumes
that the elements of the goal state are reached independently, i.e. that
the distance to the goal state equals the sum of the distances to each
element in the goal state.\\

Hoffmann's fast-forward planning system (Hoffmann 2001) is based on this
approach, but makes the following improvements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A heuristic based on the Graphplan algorithm is used. This heuristic
  takes positive interactions into account and thus provides smaller,
  more accurate estimates.
\item
  Search is faster because fewer states are considered. From a given
  state, the algorithm moves to a successor state with a better
  heuristic value. If none of the successors has a better heuristic
  value, all successors' successors are considered, etc. - until a state
  with a better heuristic is found. Hoffmann calls this \emph{enforced
  hill climbing.}
\item
  A concept of \emph{helpful actions} is used. Actions that seem not
  helpful are not considered. If this does not lead to a solution, all
  actions are considered. This finds solutions faster in most cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3) Real world applications: acting instead of
planning}\label{real-world-applications-acting-instead-of-planning}

Classical planning assumes a fixed set of states and deterministic
actions that have preconditions and effects. Planning is about finding a
sequence of actions to reach a specific goal state. For many real world
applications, this approach is too theroretical. Ghallab et al. (2014)
suggest to focus research more on \emph{acting} instead of planning.
Acting is the purpose of planning. Although planning is one important
requirement for acting, it is not sufficient. The authors use two
examples to illustrate their point: the management of a large harbor,
and a robot whose purpose is to move objects in an open environment. For
automated systems like these the following points are important:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hierarchies of components: one component receives tasks from the
  components above it. To executes this task the component can create or
  update plans, receive and analyze sensor data, or delegate subtasks to
  components below it.
\item
  Continual planning: an actor in the real world needs to interact with
  its environment and update plans continually. For some events it is
  not possible or feasible to plan ahead of time. Instead the actor
  should adjust its plan.
\item
  Uncertainty: in the real world an actor's environment is dynamic.
  Unexpected events may happen, or actions may not have the intended
  effect.
\end{itemize}

A system that takes these aspects into account needs to be more complex
than the systems used in classical planning: It has to have a better
understanding of its environment.
